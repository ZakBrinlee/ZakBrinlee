I am a passionate engineer working to be better than the day before through consistent learning and growth of myself and my skills. I enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems and the collaboration that goes into software development. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so if you have a project I would be a good fit for, please reach out!
